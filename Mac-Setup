Just a reminder that Python 2 is installed by default, and we added Python 3

So....

% Python is Python 2
% Python3 is Python 3 and what you'll generally need

Same for Pip, need to use % pip3

Python comes with pip, but it's sometimes a version behind
Upgrade to the latest pip with
% pip3 install --upgrade pip
